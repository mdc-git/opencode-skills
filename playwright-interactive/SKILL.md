# Playwright Interactive

Use persistent `repl_node` Playwright handles for browser and Electron QA.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this skill are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Sections marked **CRITICAL** are mandatory execution gates. They are not recommendations. If a CRITICAL gate is skipped or violated, the agent **MUST** stop the browser task, return to the unmet gate, and complete it before continuing. Work performed beyond a skipped gate **MUST NOT** be treated as valid verification.

## REQUIRED: REPL Tools

`repl_node`, `repl_job`, and `repl_reset` are direct OpenCode tools.

The agent **MUST** invoke these tools directly through the tool interface. The agent **MUST NOT** use `execute` to discover, invoke, or wrap them.

For `repl_node`, pass Node.js or TypeScript source directly in its `code` argument.

Use `repl_job` to inspect, cancel, or provide stdin to a retained job. Use `repl_reset` only when losing bindings and browser handles is acceptable.

## Startup

Complete the runtime setup before launching a browser or Electron application.

### REQUIRED: Playwright Runtime Setup

Use these pinned runtime versions:

* Playwright `1.60.0`
* Camoufox `0.12.0`

Store the shared runtime at:

```text
${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/opencode/playwright
```

The skill directory **MUST** contain:

```text
scripts/humanized-input.mjs
scripts/humanized-input-actions.mjs
scripts/humanized-input-input.mjs
scripts/humanized-input-target.mjs
scripts/humanized-input-utils.mjs
```

OpenCode supplies the Base directory for this skill when it is loaded. Replace `SKILL_BASE` below with that exact directory.

Run this setup cell before the browser startup block:

Run the setup cell directly in the persistent Node REPL. It invokes
`scripts/install-playwright.mjs` from inside the REPL before launching a browser.

```js
var fs = require('node:fs')
var os = require('node:os')
var path = require('node:path')
var { createRequire } = require('node:module')
var { execFile } = require('node:child_process')
var { promisify } = require('node:util')
var execFileAsync = promisify(execFile)

var PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION = '1.60.0'
var CAMOUFOX_VERSION = '0.12.0'
var PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR = path.join(
  process.env.XDG_CACHE_HOME || path.join(process.env.HOME || os.homedir(), '.cache'),
  'opencode',
  'playwright'
)
var PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH = path.join(PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR, 'browsers')
var CAMOUFOX_INSTALL_DIR = path.join(PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR, 'camoufox')
var SKILL_BASE = '/exact/base-directory-from-loaded-skill'
var PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALLER_PATH = path.join(
  SKILL_BASE,
  'scripts',
  'install-playwright.mjs'
)

fs.mkdirSync(PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR, { recursive: true })

await execFileAsync(process.execPath, [PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALLER_PATH], {
  env: process.env,
  maxBuffer: 1024 * 1024
})

process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR = PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR
process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH = PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH
process.env.CAMOUFOX_INSTALL_DIR = CAMOUFOX_INSTALL_DIR
process.env.TMPDIR = path.join(PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR, 'tmp')

var playwrightRequire = createRequire(
  path.join(PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR, '__playwright__.cjs')
)

var HUMANIZED_INPUT_PATH = path.join(SKILL_BASE, 'scripts', 'humanized-input.mjs')

if (!fs.existsSync(HUMANIZED_INPUT_PATH)) {
  throw new Error(`Humanized input helper is missing: ${HUMANIZED_INPUT_PATH}`)
}

;({
  status: 'Playwright runtime ready',
  cache: PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR,
  humanizedInput: HUMANIZED_INPUT_PATH
})
```

If the setup cell returns an active job, the agent **MUST** use `repl_job` with `status` until the job reaches a terminal state before executing the browser startup block.

### REQUIRED: Sequential REPL Calls

The agent **MUST** send each browser REPL cell as plain JavaScript in the `code` input of a direct `repl_node` tool call. The plugin executes every cell in the same persistent Node Cell.

Browser startup, inspection, and interaction cells do not need an inner tool call.

If `repl_node` returns a job whose state is `starting`, `running`, or `waiting_input`, do not submit another JavaScript cell while that job remains active. Use `repl_job` with `status` to inspect it, `cancel` to request cancellation, or `stdin` when input is required.

Every accepted evaluation has a five-second foreground window. An evaluation that remains active after that window continues as a background job. Terminal background completion is normally delivered through a synthetic session message; `repl_job` with `status` is the recovery path when another snapshot is needed.

Cancellation first requests a cooperative interrupt. If the job remains active after the fixed two-second grace period, the interpreter is hard-retired. A confirmed hard retirement loses the Node Cell's bindings and browser handles. If teardown cannot be confirmed, the Cell fails closed for the current plugin activation.

Cancellation is not rollback. Browser actions, requests, assignments, and filesystem writes may already have occurred.

If `repl_node` reports a parse error, correct the Node.js source and retry the same small cell without resetting the Node Cell.

Select exactly one startup mode. A local URL uses standard Chromium, a remote URL uses Camoufox, and Electron uses its own launcher. Do not navigate during startup. Web contexts **MUST** use `viewport: null` so the page viewport follows manual browser-window resizing instead of remaining fixed at Playwright's 1280x720 default.

### Local Web

```js
var playwright = playwrightRequire('playwright')
var chromium = playwright.chromium
var HEADLESS = false
// Set only when the user explicitly supplies a profile directory.
var PERSISTENT_PROFILE_DIR = undefined
var browser
var context
if (PERSISTENT_PROFILE_DIR) {
  context = await chromium.launchPersistentContext(PERSISTENT_PROFILE_DIR, {
    headless: HEADLESS,
    viewport: null
  })
  browser = context.browser()
} else {
  browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: HEADLESS })
  context = await browser.newContext({ viewport: null })
}
var page = context.pages()[0] || (await context.newPage())
;({ status: 'Standard Chromium opened', persistentProfile: Boolean(PERSISTENT_PROFILE_DIR) })
```

Local web uses normal Playwright input. Do not load the humanized input module.

### Remote Web

Remote web defaults to a non-persistent context. The agent **MUST** execute this lifecycle in the documented order: `firefox.launch()` returns a `Browser`, `browser.newContext()` returns a `BrowserContext`, and `context.newPage()` creates the one allowed bootstrap page. It **MUST NOT** swap the `browser` and `context` assignment targets or call `context.browser()` in this mode.

```js
var core = playwrightRequire('playwright-core')
var { launchOptions } = playwrightRequire('camoufox-js')
var HEADLESS = false
var camoufoxOptions = await launchOptions({ enable_cache: true })
var firefoxUserPrefs = {
  ...camoufoxOptions.firefoxUserPrefs,
  'browser.link.open_newwindow': 3,
  'browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction': 0
}
var browser = await core.firefox.launch({
  ...camoufoxOptions,
  firefoxUserPrefs,
  headless: HEADLESS
})
var context = await browser.newContext({ viewport: null })
var page = await context.newPage() // Initial bootstrap only; use window.open() for more tabs.
var { createHumanizedInput } = require(HUMANIZED_INPUT_PATH)
var input = createHumanizedInput()
;({ status: 'Camoufox opened' })
```

Camoufox supplies the browser-level anti-detection behavior. `input` supplies only humanized input. Playwright owns browser and context lifecycle, pages, tabs, popups, navigation, locators, frames, shadow DOM, waiting, screenshots, and assertions.

When the user explicitly supplies a profile directory, replace only the three non-persistent lifecycle lines from `var browser = ...` through `var page = ...` with this persistent lifecycle. `launchPersistentContext()` returns a `BrowserContext`, not a `Browser`; `context.browser()` then retrieves its browser. The agent **MUST NOT** combine assignments from the two lifecycle variants.

```js
var PERSISTENT_PROFILE_DIR = '/exact/user-supplied/path'
var context = await core.firefox.launchPersistentContext(PERSISTENT_PROFILE_DIR, {
  ...camoufoxOptions,
  firefoxUserPrefs,
  headless: HEADLESS,
  viewport: null
})
var browser = context.browser()
var page = context.pages()[0]
if (!page) throw new Error('Persistent context opened without a startup page')
```

### Electron

```js
var playwright = playwrightRequire('playwright')
var electronLauncher = playwright._electron
var ELECTRON_ENTRY = '.'
var electronApp = await electronLauncher.launch({ args: [ELECTRON_ENTRY] })
var appWindow = await electronApp.firstWindow()
appWindow.setDefaultTimeout(10000)
;({ status: 'Loaded Electron window', title: await appWindow.title() })
```

Electron uses normal Playwright input and never loads humanized web input.

## REPL Authoring Rules

The persistent Node Cell uses Node's built-in REPL evaluator, transpiles each snippet as CommonJS, and keeps top-level bindings across cells. Author cells to reuse existing state rather than rebuild it, and keep the shared binding scope clean.

* **Use `var` for persistent handles.** `var` bindings persist and may be reassigned or redeclared across cells. `let` and `const` also persist, but normal Node lexical rules apply: redeclaring either name in a later cell raises a `SyntaxError` such as `Identifier 'X' has already been declared`. An interrupted cell is not transactional, so a lexical name can remain reserved even when its awaited initializer did not finish. Reassign an existing `var` handle (`page = await context.newPage()`) rather than introducing a parallel one; use `globalThis` or an async function for scratch state when appropriate.
* **Prefer reusing handles over re-creating them.** `browser`, `context`, `page`, `input`, `electronApp`, `appWindow`, `fs`, `path`, and any helper you assigned in a prior cell persist into the next one. Reference them directly instead of launching a browser again, loading a module again, or recomputing a value that already exists. If a value is missing or stale, reassign the existing name rather than introducing a parallel one.
* **Use `require()` for modules.** REPL snippets are transpiled as CommonJS. Use `require()` for Node built-ins and workspace packages, `playwrightRequire()` for packages in the shared Playwright runtime, and an absolute path for the skill's synchronous `.mjs` helper module. Do not rely on static import declarations or dynamic `import()` semantics in REPL cells.
* **Respect Node's module cache.** Loaded modules are cached and are not automatically invalidated when a file changes. Reset the Node Cell before expecting an edited module to execute again, then rerun the runtime setup and the complete startup block.
* **It is a Node Cell, not a browser.** `location`, `document`, `window`, `navigator`, and `localStorage` are not defined. Reach the DOM through Playwright: `await page.evaluate(() => location.href)` or `await page.locator(...)`. Use `os.tmpdir()` and `process.cwd()` for filesystem work, not browser URLs.
* **Emit screenshots directly.** Use `opencode.emitImage({ bytes: await page.screenshot({ type: 'png' }), mimeType: 'image/png' })` to return a screenshot to the agent without writing a file.
* **Keep cells small and one-purpose.** A long single-line expression built by concatenation (regexes, nested `map`/`filter`, multiple `=>` arrows) is the main source of `Expected '}' / ']' / ')'` and `missing ) after argument list` parse errors. Split it across lines and statements; the Node Cell preserves bindings between calls, so you do not lose state by splitting.

## Persistent Profiles

Profile persistence is opt-in. Set `PERSISTENT_PROFILE_DIR` only when the user explicitly asks to reuse a profile and supplies the exact directory. Otherwise use `browser.launch()` followed by `browser.newContext()`.

A persistent profile may contain credentials, cookies and browsing history. Never inspect or expose those values unless the task explicitly requires it. If Playwright reports that the profile is locked, ask the user to close the other browser; never delete lock files.

## Element Selection

Use Playwright directly for every element lookup. The humanized input module has no locator, accessibility inventory, frame discovery, overlay discovery, popup handling or tab tracking API.

### REQUIRED: AI-Optimized Element Discovery

When the next target is not already known from current, verified evidence, the agent **MUST** capability-detect and use Playwright's AI-optimized ARIA snapshot as its first element-discovery operation. It **MUST** try `ariaSnapshot` first, then `ariaSnapshotJSON` when the first method is unavailable:

```js
var aiSnapshotOptions = { mode: 'ai', boxes: true, timeout: 5000 }
var uiSnapshot
if (typeof page.ariaSnapshot === 'function') {
  uiSnapshot = await page.ariaSnapshot(aiSnapshotOptions)
} else if (typeof page.ariaSnapshotJSON === 'function') {
  uiSnapshot = await page.ariaSnapshotJSON(aiSnapshotOptions)
} else {
  uiSnapshot = undefined
}
uiSnapshot
```

When either method is available, the agent **MUST** inspect its result before trying selectors. AI mode provides roles, accessible names, element references such as `[ref=e2]` in the text format or equivalent `ref` fields in JSON, and nested iframe snapshots. `boxes: true` adds viewport-relative element bounds. This single Playwright-native representation **SHOULD** replace repeated guessed locators, frame-by-frame searches and broad DOM inspection.

The agent **MUST NOT** assume either method exists solely from a remembered Playwright version. If neither method is available, it **MAY** fall back to exact user-facing Playwright locators plus screenshot inspection and **MUST NOT** recreate an accessibility inventory with custom DOM scripts.

When the snapshot identifies the intended element by reference, the agent **MAY** use that reference immediately for exploratory targeting:

```js
var target = page.locator('aria-ref=e2')
```

`aria-ref` is an implementation-backed, ephemeral selector rather than a documented durable selector API. The agent **MUST** use it in the frame that owns the referenced element and **MUST NOT** persist it in reusable automation. It **SHOULD** derive durable interactions from the observed role, label, text or test id using public locators such as `getByRole()` or `getByLabel()`.

ARIA references are tied to the most recent snapshot and current UI state. After another snapshot in that frame, navigation or a material DOM change, the agent **MUST** take a fresh snapshot before using a reference. It **MUST NOT** guess an `aria-ref` value.

If the relevant region is already known, the agent **SHOULD** scope the snapshot to that Playwright locator to reduce output:

```js
var dialog = page.getByRole('dialog')
var dialogSnapshot =
  typeof dialog.ariaSnapshot === 'function'
    ? await dialog.ariaSnapshot(aiSnapshotOptions)
    : typeof dialog.ariaSnapshotJSON === 'function'
      ? await dialog.ariaSnapshotJSON(aiSnapshotOptions)
      : undefined
```

On exceptionally large pages, the agent **MAY** use `depth` to bound a snapshot, but **MUST NOT** conclude that an element is absent when it may have been excluded by that depth. If the AI snapshot does not expose a visibly present control, the agent **MUST** inspect the screenshot and then use normal Playwright locators against the observed UI. An exact user-facing locator already established by current evidence **MAY** be used directly without another snapshot.

Prefer Playwright's user-facing locators:

```js
var submit = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })
var email = page.getByLabel('Email')
```

Playwright locators pierce open shadow roots by default. Use `frameLocator()` or a frame's own locator APIs for iframes. Use normal Playwright inspection and screenshots to identify overlays. Closed shadow roots are not accessible through standard Playwright locators.

### REQUIRED: Camoufox Additional Pages

The Remote Web startup configures Firefox's new-window behavior so browser-originated windows open as tabs in the existing visible browser window. The agent **MUST** navigate the initial page to the first target and **MUST NOT** use `context.newPage()` to open an additional Camoufox page, whether the context is persistent or non-persistent. Playwright-created additional Firefox pages can appear as separate visible browser windows even though `context.pages()` reports them in one context, while browser-originated pages join the same visible window as tabs. The startup block's `context.newPage()` call is allowed only to bootstrap the initial non-persistent page. This restriction does not apply to Chromium.

When a Camoufox/Firefox workflow needs a programmatically opened page rather than a visible link or button, open it through the current page's `window.open()` and let Playwright observe the browser-created page:

```js
var [additionalPage] = await Promise.all([
  context.waitForEvent('page'),
  page.evaluate((url) => window.open(url, '_blank'), TARGET_URL)
])
await additionalPage.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded')
page = additionalPage
;({ pageCount: context.pages().length, pages: context.pages().map((candidate) => candidate.url()) })
```

For multiple pages, repeat this sequence from an existing loaded page until `context.pages().length` equals the expected count. Verify the count and URLs after every `window.open()` so every page is browser-originated, remains in the same context, and appears as a tab in the same visible browser window. Do not issue multiple `window.open()` calls in one unproven batch.

For a popup or new tab, let Playwright observe the event around the action:

```js
var [popup] = await Promise.all([
  context.waitForEvent('page'),
  input.click(page, page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Open details' }))
])
await popup.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded')
page = popup
```

When an action may either navigate the current page or open a new one, compare Playwright's pages and current URL before and after the action instead of leaving an unresolved popup promise:

```js
var pagesBefore = new Set(context.pages())
var urlBefore = page.url()
await input.click(page, navigationLocator)
await page.waitForTimeout(500)
var openedPages = context.pages().filter((candidate) => !pagesBefore.has(candidate))
var navigationKind = openedPages.length
  ? 'new-page'
  : page.url() !== urlBefore
    ? 'same-page'
    : 'no-navigation'
if (openedPages.length === 1) page = openedPages[0]
;({ navigationKind, pages: context.pages().map((candidate) => candidate.url()) })
```

Do not assume the outcome.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Remote Cleanup Gate

**CRITICAL:** This mandatory gate **MUST** be the first activity after the first navigation to each remote origin. Before extracting task content, starting the requested workflow, performing the proving pass, or reporting any result, the agent **MUST** complete all of these steps in order:

1. The agent **MUST** wait roughly 1–2 seconds for delayed consent managers, overlays and popup pages to appear.
2. The agent **MUST** use the capability-detected AI snapshot procedure from **AI-Optimized Element Discovery** as the first DOM inspection, review relevant frames and `context.pages()` with normal Playwright APIs, emit a viewport screenshot with `opencode.emitImage({ bytes: await page.screenshot({ type: 'png' }), mimeType: 'image/png' })`, and visually inspect the returned image. Emitting a screenshot without visually evaluating it **MUST NOT** be treated as satisfying this step. The AI snapshot or other DOM inspection alone **MUST NOT** be used to conclude that no visible interruption exists.
3. If a cookie or consent prompt is visible, the agent **MUST** choose the affirmative control whose meaning is to accept or allow all cookie categories. Its wording and language vary by site, so the agent **MUST** identify it by meaning rather than rely on a fixed label such as `Accept all`. It **MUST NOT** choose a narrower, rejecting or settings option unless the user asks.
4. The agent **MUST** dismiss every unrelated, benign interruption that has a safe visible dismissal control. This includes newsletter prompts, surveys, promotional modals, chat invitations, interstitials and unrelated popup pages. Controls may mean close, dismiss, cancel, skip, continue without, not now or an equivalent phrase in another language. The agent **MUST** use normal Playwright locators to identify controls and humanized input to activate them. It **MUST NOT** close a popup page until Playwright inspection confirms that the page is unrelated to the requested flow.
5. In a separate pass, the agent **MUST** reinspect the page and open pages, emit a fresh screenshot, visually inspect it, and confirm that each cookie prompt, dismissed overlay and unrelated popup is gone and that the intended workflow page is active. A timed-out dismissal click can still have succeeded when the control removed itself; the agent **MUST** judge success by this verified end state and **MUST NOT** retry blindly.

The gate **MUST NOT** be considered complete while a visible cookie prompt or safely dismissible unrelated interruption remains. If a control cannot be identified confidently or the interruption cannot be dismissed, the agent **MUST** stop and inspect rather than begin the task underneath it.

The agent **MUST NOT** automatically dismiss anything that may be relevant to the task, including authentication, permission decisions, destructive confirmations, validation errors, checkout or submission confirmation, file choosers, or dialogs whose consequence is unclear. It **MUST** inspect or ask instead of guessing.

Interruptions can appear later. If a cookie prompt, overlay, modal, interstitial or popup page appears at any point, the agent **MUST** pause the current workflow immediately, apply the same inspect-dismiss-verify gate, and **MUST NOT** resume the task until that gate is complete.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Proof Gate Before Automation

**CRITICAL:** The agent **MUST NOT** write or execute a large multi-step script, loop, helper or batch of interactions based on untested assumptions about selectors, page state or transitions. Before automating a flow, it **MUST** use the persistent REPL to complete the proposed flow successfully at least once as small, sequential Playwright operations.

For the proving pass, the agent **MUST** inspect the current state, choose the next locator, perform one interaction, and verify its expected visible result before continuing. A locator resolving successfully **MUST NOT** be treated as proof that the interaction or transition works. The agent **MUST NOT** bundle an unproven next step into the same call.

Only after the complete representative sequence has worked once **MAY** the agent consolidate those exact proven steps into a larger script or repeated automation. If the UI, navigation outcome, popup behavior or other assumption differs from the proving pass, the agent **MUST** stop the automation at that divergence and **MUST** prove the changed path one step at a time before updating the script.

The agent **MUST NOT** preemptively build fallback trees, speculative selector lists, retry loops or broad DOM-evaluation scripts to cover states that have not been observed. It **MUST** inspect the actual state first and **MUST** prove each required branch before including that branch in automation.

The required startup block, read-only inspection and a single isolated interaction **MAY** proceed without a prior proving pass because they are not automation. Irreversible or externally consequential actions **MUST** remain incremental and **MUST NOT** be repeated merely to prove that a consolidated script can replay them.

## Humanized Input

For remote web, pass ordinary Playwright locators directly to `input`:

```js
await input.click(page, page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Continue' }))
await input.fill(page, page.getByLabel('Email'), 'user@example.com')
await input.hover(page, page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Details' }))
await input.check(page, page.getByLabel('Remember me'))
await input.selectOption(page, page.getByLabel('Country'), 'DE')
await input.focus(page, page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Search' }))
await input.press(page, 'Enter')
await input.scroll(page, 850)
```

Available methods are `moveTo`, `click`, `doubleClick`, `hover`, `wheel`, `scroll`, `dragTo`, `type`, `fill`, `pressText`, `press`, `focus`, `check`, `uncheck`, and `selectOption`.

`press` and `pressText` operate on the page's currently focused element and accept `(page, key)` and `(page, text)` respectively. Use `focus(page, locator)` first when focus is not already established. Other keyboard and form methods such as `type`, `fill`, `focus`, `check`, `uncheck`, and `selectOption` accept a locator as their second argument.

The module uses locator bounding boxes and hit testing only to execute pointer input against the Playwright-selected target. It does not search for, reinterpret or replace the locator.

Use direct Playwright methods for lifecycle and inspection. Emit screenshots in memory when they must be visually inspected:

```js
await page.goto(TARGET_URL, { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' })
await opencode.emitImage({
  bytes: await page.screenshot({ type: 'png' }),
  mimeType: 'image/png'
})
await page.goBack()
var pages = context.pages()
```

Humanized typing is intentionally slower. An input cell that exceeds the five-second foreground window continues as a background job; use `repl_job` to inspect or cancel it.

## Navigation And Inspection

Navigate to the user-requested origin and reach later states through visible UI controls. Do not invent deep links, query strings or form endpoints to bypass the UI.

After completing the mandatory remote cleanup gate, check whether the requested information is already present in the DOM. If it is, read it without unnecessary task interaction. When the current state or target is unclear, inspect a screenshot instead of guessing selectors.

## Session Persistence

Keep browser and Electron sessions open after completing a task. Close them only when the user asks, when switching an exclusive persistent profile between incompatible sessions, or before an unavoidable reset.

```js
if (typeof electronApp !== 'undefined') await electronApp.close().catch(() => {})
if (typeof context !== 'undefined') await context.close().catch(() => {})
if (typeof browser !== 'undefined') await browser.close().catch(() => {})
;('Playwright session closed')
```

After `repl_reset({ language: 'node' })` or a hard interpreter retirement, rerun the runtime setup and the complete startup block before interacting again.

Cancellation is not rollback: browser actions, requests, assignments, and filesystem writes may remain after a cooperative interruption. A hard interpreter retirement loses the Node Cell's bindings and browser handles. Do not blindly replay a consequential action after cancellation; inspect its result first.

If an expected persistent binding such as `browser`, `context`, `page`, or `input` is not defined, the agent **MUST** reload the `playwright-interactive` skill, rerun the runtime setup, and execute one complete startup block. It **MUST NOT** reconstruct a partial lifecycle from memory or stale tool output in the transcript. After recovery, Camoufox additional pages remain subject to the browser-originated `window.open()` requirement.
